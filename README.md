# MicroPython IMU Relay

MicroPython code that runs on an ESP connected to a BNO055 IMU, that relays the
sensor readings to a web page, an MQTT connection, or the serial port.

The serial port format is compatible with
[osteele/microbit-sensor-relay](https://github.com/osteele/microbit-sensor-relay).

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.

2. Follow the instructions
   [here](https://www.notion.so/MicroPython-4e7c9edd5b954c74bb4c08e5eac74c7f) to
   install MicroPython on an ESP32.

3. Copy `pyboard/config.py.tmpl` to `pyboard/config.py`. Edit the latter file to
   fill in the values.

4. Download the source code from the `pyboard` directory in this folder, to the MCU:

    ```sh
    pipenv run download
    ```

5. Now reboot the MCU, so that it runs the new code:

   Run `pipenv run repl`
   Press `‚åÉD`

   You can also reboot the board by pressing the button that is closest to the red LED, on the MCU board.

`pipenv run download` and `pipenv run repl` use the [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell#rshell) project to communicate with the MCU.
You can read how `pipenv run` invokes the `repl` command by inspecting the source of `Pipfile`.

`pipenv run screen` is an alternative to `pipenv run repl`, that uses the `screen` command instead of `rshell`. `screen` connects to the board more quickly than `repl`, but is more difficult to use.

[MicroPython Development
Notes](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/MicroPython-Development--Ai1pmnXzhBdkxZ6SuEPMTDiDAg-sAf2oqgmH5yIbmx27kZqs)
contains notes on developing MicroPython on the ESP.

## Examples

Run `pipenv run webserver` to start a web server.

<http://127.0.0.1:8000> displays a directory of the other web pages in this
directory.

<http://127.0.0.1:8000> displays a live D3 graph of the orientation coordinates.

<http://127.0.0.1:8000/chart.html> uses HighCharts to display another live
graph, that automatically scales the y axis as data arrives.

<http://localhost:8000/model.html> displays the bunny, with its orientation
yolked to the IMU orientation. An optional `?model=` query parameter specifies
the URL to an OBJ file, that is used as the model. The model is red before the
sensor is minimally calibrated, and it fades out when sensor data is not being
recieved.

To switch the MQTT broker for any of these web pages, press the "h" key, edit in
the new value, and then reload the page. Note: Each page has its own copy of
these settings. Changing one will not change the others.

## Command-Line Testing

Copy `config/network.ini.tmpl` to `config/network.ini` and fill in the values.
If you are running an MQTT broker on your development computer, you may leave
the new file unchanged.

Run `pipenv run mqtt-sub` to run an MQTT client that prints messages to the
terminal.

Run `pipenv run mqtt-pub` to publish a single message to the server.

Run `pipenv run mqtt-pub --repeat` to repeatedly publish messages.

## Blender

In two separate terminals:

1. `pipenv run mqtt2pipe`
2. `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender model.blend --python blender/motion.py`

If the pipe buffer fills, the `mqtt-sub` process will hang.

## MQTT Broker

To install a local broker:

1. Install RabbitMQ. On macOS with HomeBrew: `brew install rabbitmq`, and `brew
   services start rabbitmq`.
2. Install the MQTT plugin: `rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_mqtt`
3. Install the Web MQTT plugin: `rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_web_mqtt`
